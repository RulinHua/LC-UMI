Description: Corrects cross-cell amplification bias in single-cell UMI count data using LOESS regression. 
    This method adjusts total UMI counts based on per-cell amplification rates, improving the accuracy of 
    UMI-based RNA quantification. The corrected expression matrix supports downstream analyses such as 
    clustering, differential expression, and trajectory inference.
