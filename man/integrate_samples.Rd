\title{Integrate Multiple LC-UMI Matrices Across Samples}
\usage{
integrate_samples(list_rawUMI, list_LcUMI)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_rawUMI}{A named list of raw UMI count matrices (genes × cells), one matrix per sample.
The names of the list must correspond exactly to those in \code{list_LcUMI}.
For each sample, the raw and LC-UMI matrices must contain the same set of genes (rows) and cells (columns),
with consistent row and column names.}

\item{list_LcUMI}{A named list of LOESS-corrected UMI count matrices (genes × cells), one for each sample.
The names of this list must exactly match those in \code{list_rawUMI}.
For each sample, the corresponding raw and corrected matrices must have identical gene sets (row names)
and cell barcodes (column names).
\strong{Note:} Cell barcodes (i.e., column names) must be unique across all samples to avoid duplication during matrix integration.}
}
\value{
A single gene expression matrix obtained by column-wise concatenation of all corrected LC-UMI matrices,
in which each sample has been scaled by a sample-specific normalization factor derived from its raw UMI matrix.
This adjustment compensates for differences in sequencing depth and cell number across samples,
enabling fair comparison of gene expression values at the single-cell level.
}
\description{
This function integrates multiple LOESS-corrected UMI count matrices (LC-UMI) across samples
by correcting for sample-level variability in sequencing depth and cell number.
Specifically, a normalization factor is computed for each sample based on the average total UMI count per cell
in the corresponding raw UMI matrix. These factors are then used to rescale the LC-UMI matrices,
ensuring comparability of UMI counts across samples prior to integration.
This approach ensures that variation in total RNA abundance across samples due to differences in sequencing depth and cell recovery is minimized.
}
\details{
For each sample, a normalization factor is computed as the average total UMI count per cell
(i.e., \code{sum(UMIs) / number of cells}). These factors are normalized to their median across all samples,
and each LC-UMI matrix is scaled accordingly. This ensures that technical variation due to sequencing depth
and cell recovery is minimized when integrating multiple samples.
It is required that cell barcodes (i.e., column names) are unique across all samples.
If different samples contain overlapping cell names, they should be prefixed or modified beforehand
to ensure uniqueness, as duplicate column names will cause errors or data loss during integration.

\dontrun{
# Assume you have 3 samples with matching raw and LC-UMI matrices
# Make sure that all cell barcodes are unique across samples

lcumi_list <- list(S1 = LcUMI_matrix1, S2 = LcUMI_matrix2, S3 = LcUMI_matrix3)
